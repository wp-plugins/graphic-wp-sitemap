== Description ==

SEO experts and developers have a new way to graphically represent the information architecture for a website to make clients understand how important the distribution of content is.
**Graphic WP Sitemap** adds a Dashboard widget to your admin area that generates a pretty tree graphic, aka Mind Map, ia, directory tree, etc., for you to easily explore your blog's content structure.

There are Mind Mapping software out there allowing you to generate such a tree, but none of them come in WP plugin flavor like **Graphic WP Sitemap**, extracting the pages right from WP database. No need to type and re-arrange pages names or branches.


**Features**
*	Highlights page icons on roll-over to highlight pages and their child pages.
*	Optimizes page names wrapping, keeping them compact and expanding them on rollover to reveal the whole page's name.
*	Allows navigating to the clicked page in a new window.
*	Fullscreen mode for better browsing the tree.

**Future features**
*	Option to get the actual current theme's navigation menu, which could have hidden pages.
*	Option for displaying the content a human been sees through the theme or the one a search engine sees (built from sitemap.xml file)
*	Compatibility with Internet Explorer

== Installation ==

Designed for modern browsers. Best Viewed in Google Chrome (sorry Internet Explorer)

== Instructions ==
