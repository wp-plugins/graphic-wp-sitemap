The very first graphic sitemap for Wordpress, ever. A pretty mind map (I.A. tree) will show you the distribution of your site's content.

== Description ==

SEO experts and developers have a new way to graphically represent the information architecture for a website to make clients understand how important the distribution of content is.
**Graphic WP Sitemap** adds a Dashboard widget to your admin area that generates a pretty tree graphic, aka Mind Map, ia, directory tree, etc., for you to easily explore your blog's content structure.

There are Mind Mapping software out there allowing you to generate such a tree, but none of them come in WP plugin flavor like **Graphic WP Sitemap**, extracting the pages right from WP database. No need to type and re-arrange pages names or branches.


= Features =

*	Highlights page parents and children on roll-over.
*	Easy to browse with neat design. Reveals long page names on rollover.
*	Allows navigating to the clicked page in a new window.

*	Option for displaying the content seen by human beens in a browser or by search engines (built from sitemap.xml file)
*	Compatibility with Internet Explorer

== Installation ==

Just download it from my website, then go to your plugins dashboard panel and chose "Add New". There, browse your computer for the file you just downloaded and hit "upload". Activate it and find it on your dashboard. You can also download it from Wordpress plugins directory.

Designed for modern browsers. Best Viewed in Google Chrome (sorry Internet Explorer)

== Screenshots ==

1. Rollover any first and second level page to highlight it as a group with its children.
2. Rollover any third level page to reveal the whole name.
3. Click the "Fullscreen" link to expand the widget to an overlay fullscreen mode.

== Instructions ==

After installing and activating the plugin, your new widget will appear in the dashboard (/wp-admin)

To add the graphic sitemap in any page or post, just type [graphic-sitemap] in the post editor (purchase upgrade code from my site). To remove the thankyou link to my site just add the params Gsm_nocredit="TRUE" inside the square brackets.

To add a graphic sitemap to a sidebar, just drag the wp graphic sitemap widget to the desired sidebar. I recommend you use an horizontal sidebar rather. Vertical sidebars are too narrow for the sidebar to look good. If your theme lacks of one, You can hire me to add one to your theme.
